# sausages

Welcome to the demo of **sausages**  a simple Flutter project based around **ChangeNotifier**.

## Structure
The structure is simple, the *faux* API is split and created as a package and then the app is  based around the notion of
an app provider that container all the business logic so that the UI can be created  and then maintained separately.
